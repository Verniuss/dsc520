##10.3 Final Project Step 2

#•	What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn to import and cleanup your dataset?
#  •	If I have an issue with not being able to clean up the data. As in that the file itself is not orderly. Has spaces in odd places, no clear headers, etc. I will have a problem with not being able to clean it up.

#•	Discuss how you plan to uncover new information in the data that is not self-evident.
  #•	What would be a nice to have is to be able to project what the housing data could be for the following year. I could find some 2022 data to try and use it as a proof to determine if my projections from 2021 can be extrapolated to 2022

#•	What are different ways you could look at this data to answer the questions you want to answer?
#  •	I would like there to be a way to maybe make some assumptions with this data about what sorts of incomes can finance/afford the cost of a house.

#•	Do you plan to slice and dice the data in different ways, create new variables, or join separate data frames to create new summary information? Explain.
  #•	What I would also like to do is show the different costs per state how income affects the ability of purchasing power for people.

#•	How could you summarize your data to answer key questions?
#  •	I would like to create a table for each state that shows the range of incomes that can afford certain price points of housing. Given that there are these municipal costs per year per person.

#•	What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn to answer your questions?
#  •	I think I need more experience working with different types of data sets and transforming the data in different ways to get a better handle of how to use the tools within R.

#•	Do you plan on incorporating any machine learning techniques to answer your research questions? Explain.
  #•	I don’t think I am ready at this point to incorporate some machine learning techniques. This would be a bonus if I can answer all of my other questions.
